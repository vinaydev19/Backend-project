db always remember this
Two important points about database connectivity: 

1. When connecting to databases, handling potential data-not-found scenarios is essential. 
Employ try/catch blocks or promises to manage errors or we can also use promises.
key to remember : ( wrap in try-catch )

2. Database operations involve latency, and traditional synchronous code can lead to blocking, 
where the program waits for the database query to complete before moving on. So, we should async/await which allows for non-blocking execution, enabling the program to continue with other tasks while waiting for the database response.
